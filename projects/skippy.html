                   <h2>About</h2>
                   <p>Skippy The Ad Hero is a creative desktop game that teaches children, targeted in Grade 6, about marketing and how to interact with it.</p>
                   <h2>Team</h2>
                   <p>Kathy Chen, Anastasia Chupina, Tyler Garside, Susan Sun, Samuel Yee, Zachary Witt</p>

                   <h2>Role</h2>
                   <p>I was the <b>User Interface &amp; Animation Asset Designer</b>. My main role was to design and create the game assets and environment over a six week period. For a comprehensive understanding about marketing in video games, I was also responsible for designing all animation assets based off storyboard guidelines. Throughout this 6 week period, I was also involved with the conceptualization and testing of our idea.</p>

               <h2>Client</h2>
               <p><b>MediaSmarts</b> is a Canadian not-for-profit charitable organization for digital and media literacy. They have been developing digital and media literacy programs and resources for Canadian homes, schools and communities since 1996. Through MediaSmarts' work they support adults with information and tools so they can help children and teens develop the critical thinking skills they need for interacting with the media they love.</p>
               
               <h2>Problem Space</h2>
               <p>We were given the task to create a browser based game targeted towards students in elementary to early high school. Given that media is everywhere, MediaSmarts tasked us with the same goal the company tries to fulfill everyday&#8212;to teach and help kids develop critical thinking skills when engaging in media and advertisements. More specifically, our team was tasked with bringing awareness about <b>marketing in games</b>.</p>
               
               <p>Through <b>user and background research</b>, we found that media literacy levels for children from Grade 6 to Grade 8 are often low, and they are easily susceptible to marketing. Furthermore, today's children have become the most marketed-to generation in history, thanks to their spending power and their future clout as adult consumers. From our research our team decided that the core information that we want to teach kids is how marketing relates to games industry. One of the most significant types of that relationship is in-game advertising. This is a big problem for children because these ads are so bright and capturing that it is too hard not to click on it. Very often that click leads children to the unpleasant website of the advertiser. We want to show and teach ways to avoid and navigate through these scenarios.
                </p>
                
                 
                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>To explore our solution space, we looked at numerous game genres and game examples that children could play casually but did not require an investment of time. Similarly, we also thought about the physical interactions that the children would go through when interacting with advertising. We wanted to find a way to bring the physical world into the digital realm. As our first idea, we thought of a clicker game where the player would be the CEO of a marketing firm and as you clicked you could upgrade your company. While in the process of ugprading, the player would be introduced to different methods of marketing towards different demographics. Although this idea was creative, there was the issue of repetitive clicking that did not bring real value to the purpose of the game.</p> 
                 
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                   <p>After many iterations, we came up with an endless runner desktop game solution that would teach children about marketing through a personified hamster character. By bringing the physical dangers of marketing into a fictional-based narrative, we hope to captivate our demographic into playing the game while reaping the educational benefits. </p>

                        <p>Looking at games such as Canabalt and Spring Ninja helped us define our game mechanics and type of design aesthetic. Through these games, we were able to adopt their simple game mechanics while adding additional features. Plus, analyzing the different types of "endless" games, we noticed the importance of the environment and the key role it played to create the atmosphere of the game.</p>

                    <p>In the game environment, Skippy lives in a village with other hamsters. Initially the background colour will appear dull. But as Skippy progressively begins to close the advertisements throughout the game, the background’s color gradually comes backs. When I started to design this environment, I wanted to make it look children friendly and bring continuity with the flat design of Skippy’s character. However, I also wanted to make parts of the environment (such as the trees) detailed so that Skippy and the game obstacles would stand out more. Through the use of vibrant warm colors and vivid details of the environment, I wanted the environment to give the sense of achievement when the player passed the obstacles. </p>

                  <p>The advertisements in Skippy The Ad Hero represent the enemies within the game. For the player, while the advertisements may be interacting within the game, the purpose is for the user to habituate the actions of closing or ignoring the ads. For the design of these ads, I took on a flat design aesthetic, similar to the game, and tried to make the contents similar to computer ads users would see on a daily basis. The hope with this design is to help accustom children to the different types of advertisements that exist, and help them recognize what they are.</p>

              <p>By conducting user-testing, we were able to gather important insights and feedback from our targeted demographics and industry professionals that allowed us to pivot and reiterate on our concept. User-testing showed us errors in our mechanics and design of the game, but also helped generate ideas that our team have not thought about. As a result of this, it allowed us to create a game that people wanted to play. To view our session check out the video!</p> <br>

              <div class="col-sm-12">
              <p>After conducting user testing we learned that we needed to clear up the overall story as to why Skippy, our character, was the main focus of the game. We had not implemented our backstory into the game, as a result, the game was too plain and players had no idea what the objective of the game was and did not know why they needed to take certain actions. An observation our team made was that if the player were not told the background story, they were generally less interested in playing the game. </p>
              
              <p>Based off this feedback, Susan Sun (one of my team members) and I created a background narrative to help give the game an objective and purpose. While we both came up with the narrative and storyboards together, Susan was mainly in charge of sketching and creating the line art for the narrative, while I was in charge of colouring. This was my first experience having a taste in digital painting while using Clip Paint Studios, however, it was eye opening experience that showed me the many applications that digital painting had for visual designs.</p>

              <p>The main goal of our video is to introduce kids to marketing as a term itself and demonstrate how it relates to games that they play. Our hope was to provide children insights about the role of marketing in the gaming industry, several unpleasant effects it causes (ex. in-game advertising), and how to navigate through marketing scenarios. Our educational video took on the form of an animation. We wanted to make it simple so that children would understand the main message of the video. Similarly, we created an animation that was related to Skippy, so that our users would have a relatable character to learn from and interact with. </p>
               
               <p>I created all the animation assets and used a design aesthetic that was similar to the game. By using bright and warm colours, I hoped to create a positive and friendly atmosphere that would set the tone for the video. To view the animation, watch the video!</p>
