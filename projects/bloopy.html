               <h2>Problem Space</h2>
                   <p>We were given the task to create a mobile application that targeted a current <b>social need</b>. From this general problem, we conducted an environmental scan to narrow our problem space. We found that at a very young age children are very capable. They know how to operate mobile devices before they even learn how to read or ride their first bike. Operating these devices have become intuitive and desirable to them&#8212;children rather play games on mobile devices than learn and improve their literary competency. Exploring the problem space not only helped us define our problem and find our target users, but helped substantiate why a mobile application would be best suited for our target users.
                    </p>
              
                 <h2>User Personas</h2>
                 <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/bloopy/persona1.jpg"></div>
                 <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/bloopy/persona2.jpg"></div>
                 <p>We did not know anything about our end-users, but we knew that we wanted to focus on a solution that targeted children. From conducting user research, we developed personas that helped us comprehend our user behaviours. These personas helped us understand and consider how to design for children, and brought to our attention that the parents were a major factor to consider.</p>
                 
                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>To explore our solution space, we framed statements that helped guide our thinking&#8212;<b><u>how might we</u> make learning more engaging and captivating for a younger audience?</b> We brainstormed different methods that would help capture interest and allow for sustained interaction. We all concluded that the best option would be a gamified experience—due to the fact that there was a disparity between education and games. As a result, we started to draw inspiration from various games and our past experiences.
</p> 
                 
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                   <p>We came up with a mobile gaming app solution that would use brain psychology techniques, personalized learning features, and gamification to create an immersive environment that facilitated successful learning in younger children. With an identifiable character, unique rewards system, and a virtual world with various games we aim to make learning fun while implicitly teaching children.

                <p>Drawing on various inspiration not only guided my thinking, but also helped inspire the designs and interface. This was my first time designing a mobile game so I did not know what to expect, and what made it more challenging was designing for kids. However, by analyzing the interface and design of many numerous children games, I noticed that these types of games had similar things in common. (1) The use of simple art styles that incorporated many different colours. (2) A rewards based system that allowed for customizability for sustained interaction and personalization. (3) Numerous simple, but intricate environment designs which allow for further exploration. These observations became crucial to the development of the design. </p>

                   <p>Using Balsamiq, I created wireframes with one of my team members, Toluwa Awodiya, to map out our ideas and to create screen flow to better understand and communicate our ideas with one another. Creating these basic screens, helped us find the optimal journey to provide an effortless experience to our users. Additionally, it helped our team figure out the scope of the project, and provided guidelines that assisted me in the creation of the game assets.</p>

                       <br>
                       <p>For the design of the game, we decided on taking a <b>flat design</b> aesthetic. With the idea of minimalism at the forefront, we thought this was a great design choice as it helped keep the game simple and focused on the content, rather than distracting and eclipsing over the content. By creating the game in a two-dimensional environment while adopting flat design principles, it helped construct a cute and simple cartoon environment that provided the perfect space for children to explore and learn. Not only that, Bloopy being an overly simplified character, this aesthetic played well with the character design and helped with the personification of our character. Plus, flat design assets were easier to create and enabled me to produce more assets to make our viable prototype.

                       <br>
                       <p>Adopting the same design principles of the game environment, I created icons for the different features of the game. By designing icons that had associations to real life objects and activities, children would be able to easily interpret the purpose of each icon. Likewise, rather than oversimplifying the icons, I added details that would stand out more so that children would be drawn to interact with them and be able to determine that the interactions are different than the rest of the interface.

               <p>Although I was not the lead prototyper, I had the opportunity to experiment with <b>JustInMind</b>. This program was different compared to the other prototyping tools I have used in the past. What was unique was that it allowed for a collaborative environment and provided visual transitions that helped with material design. JustInMind provided our team with the right features that allowed us to effectively convey our solution. To view the full prototype, click the video below!

           <p>After the completion of the project, our team received a lot of positive feedback and suggestions to make this project a real product. By winning the <b>Fan Favourite Award</b> at the first Global Business and Digital Arts Showcase it was a great way to conclude the project, but it also validated and motivated us to take this project a step further&#8212;we attempted our first entrepreneurial venture as Theratos. We had mentors from the Waterloo Accelerator Center who taught us about market validation, and our team took a <b>Foundations of Venture Creation</b> course that taught us about turning an idea into a business.</p><br>
           
           <p>In the end our idea did not succeed, but I learned a lot from the experience that I would be able to apply if another idea came up that was worth pursuing. The most important lessons I learned was that: (1) You may have great ideas, but you always need to conduct thorough market and user research to validate if your idea is worth pursuing. (2) It is better to <b><i>fail fast</i></b> and learn from your mistakes. Prototypes don't always have to be the most viable at the start, they should just convey the ideas effectively. It is always important to reiterate and pivot based off of user feedback. With this, it would be easier to build and reorient more effectively.</p>
