                   <p>Hack IX is Canada's first <b>ad tech hackathon</b>, where students from across Canada are being brought together at the University of Toronto by Index Exchange to innovate, connect and create in 48 hours. The goal of this event is to empower students to show the ad tech world what they are capable of, and to create a product that might disrupt an industry or be the advertising analytics tools of the future.</p>

               <div class="col-sm-12">
                   <p>At the beginning of the hackathon we were given a JSON dataset and Index Exchange’s API to help inspire and give us a starting point for our idea. We were also given workshops in <b>design-thinking methodologies</b> and an overview of <b>ReactJS</b> so that we could create an effective and functioning prototype. Throughout these sessions, mentors suggested that we should use the API and given dataset as the building blocks for our idea given the time constraint&#8212;we took that into consideration and used that as the starting point for exploration into the ad tech world.</p>

               <div class="col-sm-12">
                   <p>Given general guidelines and hardly any limitations to what we could create, we were at an impasse. Our team agreed that we did not want to create a typical dashboard that just displayed the numbers in a graphical format&#8212;that was not creative and generally had a bad user experience. The first thing we could do was to just <b>study the data</b> and understand the contents. What we noticed was that we generally knew what the data points represented, however, we were no expert in understanding the analytical capabilities of these dataset. </p>
                   
                   <p>This was where talking to a current HackWithIX employee helped. We discussed how HackWithIX fit into the general ad tech industry, what roles the employees had to play within the company, the general flow of the service that HackWithIX provides, and what type of analysis &amp; visualization they usually conduct on datasets.</p><br>
                    <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/hackwithix/p01.jpg"></div>
                  <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="img-responsive img-padding" src="img/hackwithix/p02.jpg"></div>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                   <p>By <b>conducting user research</b>, this was where we found our underlying problem and pain points that were faced daily. When representing data, there is always the notion that interactive dashboards with correlating graphs are the best method for visualization. However, that is far from the truth. Most dashboards provide horrible first time user experiences where users have to get over a learning curve to fully understand the data. Furthermore, they provide way too much information for a person to take meaningful information away at a glance.</p>
                   <p>User research not only helped us explore the problem space, but also helped reaffirm our decision for not pursuing a dashboard design. From hearing simple stories, we were able to understand and find a simple solution to a problem that could be applied across multiple industries.</p>

                <div class="row">
                 <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/hackwithix/wireframe.png"></div>

                   <p>At the core, we wanted to visualize data in a way that wasn’t a dashboard or a graphical interface. Something <b>innovative and unique</b> that anyone could generally wrap their heads around and just get the important information at a glance. Our idea was an animated interface that took the data from Index Exchange's API (as a framework) and represented the information in a visual and easy to understand manner. This interface could be placed as screensavers on laptops or as a lobby piece, so that employees could check on the status of information at a glance.</p>
                    
                     <p>Essentially the graphical visualization consisted of three monoliths which represent Index Exchange’s data centers. The weather above each monolith represent the number of ad impressions cross referenced with their spending. If the ratio is above what they hit yesterday it is a sunny day. If they hit below then it is a rainy day.</p>

                    <p>The dot matrix that is represented on each monolith shows the current operating capacity of their servers. If a dot turns red, it represents the fact that their servers are running under the optimal threshold and that something needs to be fixed or optimized.</p> 

                    <p>The sine wave at the bottom of each monolith represents the servers response time and how fast it can deliver data packets.</p>

                    <p>The little engineer is the “fixer”. Whenever he runs over to a server that means it is performing below its average performance level. This indicates that something is going slightly wrong and that the engineers should look into it.</p>

                  <p>Doing a hackathon, our team had an ideology where we needed something that would surprise the panel of judges to remember us and our pitches&#8212;<b>something memorable</b>. During our research, we found that there was a trend in data visualization where users wanted data analytics on-demand and on their mobile devices. This was where we focused our efforts to create something extra, a mobile prototype of our interface that was simple and intuitive to use.

                  <p>As a result of our team's hardwork and ideologies, we got <b>first place</b> in the HackWithIX hackathon and were all rewarded with brand new iPhone 7.</p>
